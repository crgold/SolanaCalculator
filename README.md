# Rust Calculator on Solana

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript
API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to
interact with programs on the Solana blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain calculator program that performs addition and subtrations
* A client that can send a an operation and opperands to an account and return the result

## Quick Start

[![Open in
Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/crgold/SolanaCalculator.git)

If you decide to open in Gitpod then refer to
[README-gitpod.md](README-gitpod.md), otherwise continue reading.

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example, depending
on your OS, they may already be installed:

- Install node (v14 recommended)
- Install npm
- Install Rust v1.56.1 or later from https://rustup.rs/
- Install Solana v1.10.35 or later from
  https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

If this is your first time using Rust, these [Installation
Notes](README-installation-notes.md) might be helpful.

### Configure CLI

> If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run these commands

1. Set CLI config url to localhost cluster

```bash
solana config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

2. Create CLI Keypair

If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

### Start local Solana cluster

This example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

Start a local Solana cluster:
```bash
solana-test-validator
```
> **Note**: You may need to do some [system tuning](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#system-tuning) (and restart your computer) to get the validator to run

Listen to transaction logs:
```bash
solana logs
```

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the on-chain program

There is both a Rust and C version of the on-chain program, whichever is built
last will be the one used when running the example.

```bash
npm run build:program-rust
```

```bash
npm run build:program-c
```

### Deploy the on-chain program

```bash
solana program deploy dist/program/solana_calculator.so
```

### Run the JavaScript client

```bash
npm run start
```

### Expected output

Public key values will differ:

```bash
Let's do some math...
Connection to cluster established: https://api.devnet.solana.com { 'feature-set': 4033350765, 'solana-core': '1.16.18' }
Using account 9piVDFEFLRDDQVeb32shWbAN7tvcYJc73oD3gaC5Xgvp containing 27.956692632 SOL to pay for fees
Using program 143MFttHUqpuKfKMHUbK5RKV8Gf2KD3aYthuyq8qM9JJ
Creating account AVsDKrwm6nw3EhVNX9FeTifKQprRs1DAcBqVcb757GBL to save calculator results to
Result of input:
1 + 1 is equal to 2
Success
```

#### Not seeing the expected output?

- Ensure you've [started the local cluster](#start-local-solana-cluster),
  [built the on-chain program](#build-the-on-chain-program) and [deployed the program to the cluster](#deploy-the-on-chain-program).
- Inspect the program logs by running `solana logs` to see why the program failed.
  - ```bash
    Transaction executed in slot 5621:
    Signature: 4pya5iyvNfAZj9sVWHzByrxdKB84uA5sCxLceBwr9UyuETX2QwnKg56MgBKWSM4breVRzHmpb1EZQXFPPmJnEtsJ
    Status: Error processing Instruction 0: Program failed to complete
    Log Messages:

      Program G5bbS1ipWzqQhekkiCLn6u7Y1jJdnGK85ceSYLx2kKbA failed: Program failed to complete

### Customizing the Program

To customize the example, make changes to the files under `/src`.  If you change
any files under `/src/program-rust` or `/src/program-c` you will need to
[rebuild the on-chain program](#build-the-on-chain-program) and [redeploy the program](#deploy-the-on-chain-program).

Now when you rerun `npm run start`, you should see the results of your changes.

## Learn about Solana

More information about how Solana works is available in the [Solana
documentation](https://docs.solana.com/) and all the source code is available on
[github](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana)

## Learn about the client

The client in this example is written in TypeScript using:
- [Solana web3.js SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
- [Solana web3 API](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js)

### Entrypoint

The [client's
entrypoint](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/main.ts#L13)
does five things.

### Establish a connection to the cluster

The client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling
[`establishConnection`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L92).

### Establish an account to pay for transactions

The client ensures there is an account available to pay for transactions,
and creates one if there is not, by calling
[`establishPayer`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L102).

### Check if the calculator on-chain program has been deployed

In [`checkProgram`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hcalculator.ts#L144),
the client loads the keypair of the deployed program from `./dist/program/calculator-keypair.json` and uses
the public key for the keypair to fetch the program account. If the program doesn't exist, the client halts
with an error. If the program does exist, it will create a new account with the program assigned as its owner
to store program state (number of hello's processed).

### Send a transaction to the on-chain program

The client then constructs and sends a calculation transaction to the program by
calling
[`sayHello`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/calculator.ts#L209).
The transaction contains a single very simple instruction that primarily carries
the public key of the hcalculator program account to call and the results
account to which the client wishes to store the result in.

### Query the Solana account used in the calculator transaction

Each time the client poerforms a calculation, the program stores the result in the account's data. The client queries the
result account's data to discover the last result by calling
[`reportGreetings`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/calculator.ts#L226).

## Learn about the on-chain program

The [on-chain calculator program](/src/program-rust/Cargo.toml) is a Rust program
compiled to [Berkeley Packet Filter
(BPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) bytecode and stored as an
[Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) shared
object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

The program is written using:
- [Solana Rust SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/sdk)

### Programming on Solana

To learn more about Solana programming model refer to the [Programming Model
Overview](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview).

To learn more about developing programs on Solana refer to the [On-Chain
Programs Overview](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/overview)

## Pointing to a public Solana cluster

Solana maintains three public clusters:
- `devnet` - Development cluster with airdrops enabled
- `testnet` - Tour De Sol test cluster without airdrops enabled
- `mainnet-beta` -  Main cluster

Use the Solana CLI to configure which cluster to connect to.

To point to `devnet`:
```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```

To point back to the local cluster:
```bash
solana config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

## Writing the client in Rust

This example details writing the client code in typescript; however
the Solana client program can be written in any language. For an
example client written in Rust and an accompanying write up see [this
repo](https://github.com/ezekiiel/simple-solana-program).

## Expand your skills with advanced examples

There is lots more to learn; The following examples demonstrate more advanced
features like custom errors, advanced account handling, suggestions for data
serialization, benchmarking, etc...
